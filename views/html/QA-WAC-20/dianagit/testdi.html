	 Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence

   </li>
     <p>
	  We test software to discover issues, so that they can be fixed before they are deployed to live environments – this enables us to have confidence that our systems are working. However, this testing process does not confirm that any software is completely correct and completely devoid of issues. Testing helps greatly reduce the number of undiscovered defects hiding in software, but finding and resolving these issues is not itself proof that the software or system is 100% issue-free. This concept should always be accepted by teams, and effort should be made to manage client expectations.

      <p>
   As much as we would like to believe or wish it true(!), it is absolutely impossible to test EVERYTHING – all combinations of inputs and preconditions – and you could also argue that attempting to do so is not an efficient use of time and budget. However, one of the skills of testing is assessing risks and planning your tests around these – you can then cover vast areas, while making sure you are testing the most important functions. With careful planning and assessment, your test coverage can remain excellent and enable that necessary confidence in your software, without requiring that you test every single line of code.
